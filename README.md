# hybrid-cryptosystem-aes-luc

In data and telecommunications, cryptography is required when communicating over untrusted media which includes almost all communication networks especially on the Internet. This study applies a cryptography technique called hybrid cryptosystem, which is a technique of combining the symmetric and asymmetric algorithms of cryptography, using the security and speed of the symmetric algorithm along with the strength of the asymmetric algorithm in distributing secure keys. The symmetry algorithm used is the AES algorithm while the asymmetric algorithm used is the LUC algorithm. Based on the test results, it can be concluded that the combination of the AES and LUC algorithms in this hybrid cryptosystem method can work well and is considered strong in terms of security because it has an avalanche effect value that meets the criteria with a value of 49.97% for the AES algorithm and 53.52% for the LUC algorithm.
